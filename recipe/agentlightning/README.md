# Agent Training with verl + Agent Lightning

**The recipe is tested with verl v0.5.0, vLLM v0.10.0, and Agent Lightning v0.1.1.**

This recipe might be useful to you if you are seeking to extend `verl` to:

- Incorporate offloaded actor rollouts out of `verl` management;
- Customize an async server by inheriting from `AsyncServerBase`;
- Train on an arbitrary dataset which is not natively supported by `verl`;
- Design new algorithms and plug-in new configurations.

Not completed. This README needs more love.
