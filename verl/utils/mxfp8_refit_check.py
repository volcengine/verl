"""Post-refit self-check for MXFP8 rollout layers.

Why. Both rollout engines derive kernel-specific copies of the MXFP8 weight scales
at load time (swizzled / packed layouts). A weight sync rewrites the canonical
``weight`` / ``weight_scale`` tensors; if the derived copy is not rebuilt, the
kernel pairs fresh weights with stale scales and generates garbage while every
sync-side check passes (observed on 2xB200 with SGLang 0.5.12 + FlashInfer
CUTLASS: held-out accuracy 0.0 from step 0, kl 7.2, entropy ~ log(vocab), exit
code 0). The failure is invisible to the sync path because the sync itself
succeeded; only the kernel's *output* is wrong.

What. After the engine-specific re-processing, run one MXFP8 linear layer's own
``apply`` on a small random input and compare against a plain bf16 reference
computed from the canonical fp8 weight and UE8M0 scale. The kernel quantizes the
activation to MXFP8 internally, so a healthy layer differs from the reference by
a few percent; a layer reading a stale or mis-laid-out scale differs by O(1).

Knobs (environment variables, read at call time):

- ``VERL_MXFP8_REFIT_CHECK`` — ``warn`` (default) logs a failed check and lets the
  sync go on, ``raise`` stops the sync with ``RuntimeError``, ``0`` skips the checks.
- ``VERL_MXFP8_REFIT_CHECK_TOL`` — relative-error threshold (default ``0.25``).
- ``VERL_MXFP8_REFIT_CHECK_MOE_TOL`` — threshold for the MoE expert probe
  (defaults to the linear threshold; the gated MLP compounds the activation
  quantization noise of two GEMMs).

MoE experts. The same stale-layout failure applies to the fused expert weights
``w13`` / ``w2`` (their scales are rewritten in place by the MoE runner), so one
local expert is probed the same way: every probe row is routed to that expert
with weight 1.0 and the layer's own forward is compared against
``silu(x @ w1^T) * (x @ w3^T) @ w2^T`` on the dequantized weights.
