Context manager that temporarily switches the global Ulysses SP group.

DeepSpeed workers may colocate multiple roles (actor/ref/critic) inside a single
process, but the Ulysses kernels rely on a module-level singleton for the
sequence-parallel process group.  This manager allows each role to stash its own
group and restore it around forward/backward regions to avoid cross-role
interference.
