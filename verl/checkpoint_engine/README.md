Checkpoint Engine
---

### Overview

Checkpoint Engine is an unified abstract layer to synchronize weights between various training backends and inference backends. It provides three unified APIs:
- send_weights: get named tensors from generator and send them in streaming manner.
- receive_weights: return a tensor generator that yield named tensors in streaming manner.
- get_weights: return a tensor generator that yield named tensors in streaming manner, used for each inference instance update weight independently from local cache (e.g share memory, disk).

##### filesystem ckpt engine detail:

Set `engine_kwargs.filesystem.path` to a directory mounted on all actor and rollout nodes, e.g. the same HDFS directory mounted through fuse:

```bash
actor_rollout_ref.rollout.checkpoint_engine.backend=filesystem \
+actor_rollout_ref.rollout.checkpoint_engine.engine_kwargs.filesystem.path=/mnt/hdfs/path/to/weights \
+actor_rollout_ref.rollout.checkpoint_engine.engine_kwargs.filesystem.distributed_write=True
```

`distributed_write` is enabled by default: actor ranks write different HF shards in parallel; disable it to make rank 0 write all shards.

##### kimi_ckpt_engine detail:

In the kimi_ckpt_engine workflow, the actor first offloads the weights to the CPU, and the rollout creates a sub communication group that includes all the cards for the rollout. Then, using Mooncake transfer engine, these weights are transmitted via P2P to a specific worker in the rollout, followed by a broadcast to all other rollout workers.

This mode requires the P2P feature of checkpoint_engine. Please ensure you have installed it via pip install 'checkpoint-engine[p2p]' and that your version is 0.4.0 or higher.

In addition, during the installation of checkpoint-engine[p2p], the transfer engine will be installed. However, This library has no prebuilt packages for Ascend devices and must be compiled from source. For detailed compilation instructions, see: [transfer-engine: ascend direct](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake/blob/main/docs/source/design/transfer-engine/ascend_direct_transport.md)

Note: Important Configuration for Ascend Devices
1. In Ascend 950, you need enable whitelist to support kimi-checkpoint-engine. you should set the following environment variable and create
a json file to add your device ip addresses.

```bash
export HCCL_WHITELIST_DISABLE=0
export HCCL_WHITELIST_FILE=/path/to/whitelist.json
```

In whitelist json file, you need to add IP addresses using the following format.

```json
{ "host_ip": ["ip1"], ["ip2"] }
```

2. If you are using CANN version >= 8.5.0 on Ascend devices, you must set the following environment variable to enable intra-node ROCE:

```bash
export HCCL_INTRA_ROCE_ENABLE=1
```

### Benchmark
1. benchmark setup
- model: Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base
- actor: fsdp world_size=2 (since Ascend 910C has 64GB of HBM, we set world_size=4)
- rollout: num_rollout=30 (only receive weight without cuda ipc to vllm/sglang)
```bash
pytest tests/checkpoint_engine/test_correctness_on_gpu.py
pytest tests/checkpoint_engine/test_correctness_on_npu.py
pytest tests/checkpoint_engine/test_special_server_adapter.py
