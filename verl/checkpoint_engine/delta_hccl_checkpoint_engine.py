"""Delta weight-sync checkpoint engine (HCCL transport) for Ascend NPU rollouts.

Same seed/steady state machine, wire schema and flush manifest as the NCCL
variant (:mod:`verl.checkpoint_engine.delta_checkpoint_engine`); the transport
is a ``PyHcclCommunicator`` broadcast group whose consumers are the vLLM worker
processes themselves (the direct-receiver geometry):

* the trainer-side rank 0 builds its communicator lazily at the first publish
  and broadcasts each flush's positions+values after the zmq manifest, with an
  explicit ``torch.npu.synchronize()`` before the buffers go out of scope (no
  cupy staging: PyHccl enqueues on the current stream, so holding the tensor
  references across the sync point is sufficient);
* the rollout-side CheckpointEngineWorkers never join the broadcast group --
  ``receive_weights`` relays one rendezvous control item (zmq + stateless group
  endpoints, group geometry) to the rollout adapter, which drives the vLLM
  worker engines through their weight-transfer lifecycle RPCs;
* both sides keep the communicator across sync rounds (HCCL group setup is
  expensive; mirrors the dense HCCL engine's ``rebuild_group=False`` reuse).

The lazy rendezvous is gated by per-rank wire-ready receipts: every receiver
connects its zmq SUB, joins the group and raises a ``delta_wire_ready/{rank}``
flag in the group's TCPStore; the trainer polls those flags
(:func:`verl.checkpoint_engine.delta_sync.hccl_receiver.wait_delta_wire_ready`)
before publishing the first manifest. Code order alone cannot make the stream
lossless -- ``zmq.Socket.connect()`` is asynchronous -- while the flags order
the first publish after every receiver joined, giving each subscription
(initiated before its join) the whole join duration to reach the PUB socket.
