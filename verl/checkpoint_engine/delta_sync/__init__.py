"""Delta weight sync primitives for the checkpoint engine.

This package holds the framework-agnostic wire schema of "send only the
elements that changed" weight sync: the per-flush parameter spec
(:class:`DeltaParam` / :class:`DeltaFlush`) and the payload checksum. The
sharded engines assemble these flushes from backend-provided shard exports and
broadcast them over NCCL; the rollout backend decodes them in place.

Design follows THUDM/slime's delta-sync implementation
(``slime/backends/megatron_utils/update_weight/update_weight_from_distributed_delta.py``).
