# FP8 RL in verl

Last updated: 10/12/2026

verl supports two FP8 modes for accelerating RL training:

| Mode | Training Precision | Rollout Precision |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **FP8 Rollout Only** | BF16 | FP8 |
| **FP8 End-to-End** | FP8 (Megatron) | FP8 (vLLM) |

## FP8 Rollout Only

FP8 rollout-only mode keeps training in BF16 and quantizes rollout inference to FP8. This reduces GPU memory during generation and speeds up rollout without affecting training precision.

### Implementation

We monkey patch several vLLM functions to enable FP8 rollout for reinforcement learning:

1. **Quantize weights**: Quantize model weights on-the-fly from higher-precision formats to FP8.
2. **Process weights after loading**: For vLLM, we replace the `vllm.model_executor.layers.quantization.fp8.Fp8LinearMethod.process_weights_after_loading` function to handle weight processing after quantization. For SGLang, this patch is not needed as it natively supports loading quantized weights.

### Support Matrix

- FP8 blockwise quantization for rollout
  - Used in Deepseek, which is 1x128 quantization for activations and 128x128 quantization for model weights
- Dense models and MoE models
- Async rollout interfaces
- vLLM 0.10.x & vLLM 0.11 & vLLM 0.12 & SGLang 0.5.5
- FSDP and Megatron training backends

### Usage

Enable in config file:

```yaml
rollout:
  quantization: "fp8"
```

Or via command line:

```bash
actor_rollout_ref.rollout.quantization=fp8
```

#### Skipping layers in SGLang FP8 rollout

When using SGLang FP8 rollout, you can skip FP8 weight quantization for
selected modules. Skipped modules stay in the rollout model dtype instead
of being converted to FP8. This is useful for layers that are not
compatible with block-wise FP8 weight quantization, or for modules that
you prefer to keep in higher precision.

Set `SGLANG_FP8_IGNORED_LAYERS` before starting training:

```bash
SGLANG_FP8_IGNORED_LAYERS=linear_attn \
python3 -m verl.trainer.main_ppo \
  actor_rollout_ref.rollout.name=sglang \
  actor_rollout_ref.rollout.quantization=fp8 \
  ...
```

Multiple entries can be separated by commas:

```bash
SGLANG_FP8_IGNORED_LAYERS=linear_attn,visual
```

You can also use the model `quantization_config`:

```json
{
  "quantization_config": {
    "ignored_layers": ["re:.*linear_attn.*"]
  }
}
```

Plain module names, full module paths, and `re:` regex patterns are
supported. verl applies the same ignored-layer rules when launching
SGLang and when syncing updated actor weights into the rollout engine.

## FP8 End-to-End (Training + Rollout)

FP8 E2E applies FP8 to the entire RL pipeline: forward/backward passes via Transformer Engine, FP8 optimizer states, and FP8 rollout inference via vLLM. This maximizes memory savings and throughput.

### Requirements

- **CUDA 12.9+** (required for block-wise FP8 scaling)
- **Transformer Engine** with block-wise FP8 support
- Environment variable: `NVTE_FP8_BLOCK_SCALING_FP32_SCALES=1`, on **Hopper only**. Do not set it on Blackwell (SM100+): there Transformer Engine runs block-wise scaling through MXFP8 GEMMs, whose E8M0 scales hold only an exponent, so it requires power-of-two block scales and stops at the first FP8 quantization with `Assertion failed: pow2_scale ... requires using power of two scaling factors` when the variable is set (see [#6172](https://github.com/verl-project/verl/issues/6172)). Leaving it unset gives power-of-two scales, the Transformer Engine default.

### Key Configuration

```yaml
# FP8 training via Transformer Engine
actor_rollout_ref.actor.megatron.override_transformer_config:
  fp8: "hybrid"              # FP8 forward + backward; also supports "e4m3"
  fp8_recipe: "blockwise"    # block-wise scaling

# FP8 optimizer
actor_rollout_ref.actor.optim.override_optimizer_config:
  fp8_recipe: "blockwise"

# FP8 rollout inference (vLLM)
actor_rollout_ref.rollout:
  quantization: fp8
```

### Support Matrix

- Megatron training backend (via Megatron-Bridge)
- Verified on Qwen3-30B-A3B and Qwen3-8B
- Block-wise FP8 scaling (`fp8_recipe: "blockwise"`)

### Experiments and Results

#### Qwen3-30B-A3B MoE Model

**Configuration**
- DAPO recipe. AIME24 online validation.
- Megatron + Megatron-Bridge, FP8 async rollout with vLLM
- MoE router in BF16 for both vLLM and Megatron-Core
- Prompt batch size 128, n=16
- Max response length 20K
- Token-level TIS, C=2
- 2\*8*H100, CUDA 12.9

![Qwen3-30b-a3b_fp8_e2e](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70fb1396-ec73-40d7-9a43-1d48553c0ad9)
*Orange: BF16, Green: FP8 E2E, Red: FP8 rollout + BF16 training*

Results and observations:
- FP8 E2E achieves comparable accuracy to the BF16 baseline, with the two curves closely aligned throughout training.
- The training/inference precision mismatch (measured by KL divergence) follows the ordering: FP8 rollout-only > FP8 E2E > BF16 E2E. This is expected, as FP8 E2E maintains consistent precision across both training and inference, resulting in lower distribution mismatch than the FP8 rollout-only setting where training remains in BF16.

## MXFP8 Training (Blackwell)

MXFP8 is the OCP microscaling FP8 format: E4M3 elements with one shared E8M0 scale per
32-element block, natively accelerated by Blackwell tensor cores. Compared to the
`blockwise` recipe above (1x128 activation / 128x128 weight scaling, designed for Hopper),
MXFP8 uses hardware-decoded block scales and needs no `NVTE_FP8_BLOCK_SCALING_FP32_SCALES`
workaround.

### Requirements

- **Blackwell GPUs** (SM100+). On Hopper, use `fp8_recipe: "blockwise"` as described in
  the FP8 End-to-End section instead — Hopper tensor cores cannot consume MXFP8 block scales.
- **Megatron-Core >= 0.13** and **Transformer Engine >= 2.1**

### Key Configuration

```yaml
# MXFP8 training via Transformer Engine
actor_rollout_ref.actor.megatron.override_transformer_config:
  fp8: "e4m3"                # element format; "hybrid" (e4m3 fwd + e5m2 bwd) also supported
  fp8_recipe: "mxfp8"        # 32-element block scaling
```

Notes:

- Training uses the Megatron-Bridge model path (`actor_rollout_ref.actor.megatron.use_mbridge=True`),
  which is now the only Megatron model-building path in verl.
- Model weights stay in bf16 (`fp8_param` is not supported); only GEMM inputs are cast to
  MXFP8 on the fly, so checkpointing is unchanged.
- verl pads packed sequences to the 32-token block boundaries MXFP8 quantization requires
  (`lcm(32, ...)` per sequence instead of the blockwise recipe's `lcm(16, ...)`); this is automatic
  once `fp8_recipe: "mxfp8"` is set.
- QAT and Transformer Engine FP8 training are mutually exclusive (QAT fake-quantizes weights inside
  bf16 GEMMs, while an FP8 recipe switches the GEMMs themselves to FP8); the engine refuses the
  combination at initialization.
- `verl.utils.mxfp8_quant.mxfp8_quantize` exposes the TE `MXFP8Quantizer` the learner applies to its
  weights, for weight synchronization to an MXFP8 rollout engine; `lm_head` and the token embedding
  stay in high precision there (`MXFP8_KEEP_HIGH_PRECISION_LAYERS`).

### MXFP8 Rollout and Train-Inference Consistency

With `quantization: mxfp8`, the rollout engine is launched in MXFP8 mode against the bf16
checkpoint (a `quantization_config` override, no offline conversion), and every weight sync
quantizes the bf16 actor weights to MXFP8 on the fly:

```yaml
actor_rollout_ref.rollout:
  name: vllm
  quantization: mxfp8
```

The weight-sync quantization deliberately uses **TransformerEngine's `MXFP8Quantizer`**
(`verl.utils.mxfp8_quant`), the same quantizer the trainer's FP8 GEMMs apply to weights, so the
rollout engine serves exactly the weight grid the training forward pass saw. An independent
quantization kernel can round E8M0 scales differently at block boundaries and reintroduce
train-inference mismatch. Two things still differ by construction: the engine quantizes activations
with its own kernels, and its GEMMs accumulate in a different order. Pairing with token-level TIS is
recommended, as with the blockwise FP8 E2E recipe.

For vLLM, the config maps to `ModelOptMxFp8Config` (weight `fp8_e4m3fn` + `uint8` UE8M0
`weight_scale`, block `[1, 32]`). `lm_head`, the token embedding and the MoE routers stay in bf16
through `ignored_layers`, and verl opts its generated config into exact module-path matching of those
exclusions ([mxfp8_exclusion_patch.md](mxfp8_exclusion_patch.md)); vLLM 0.24's substring fallback would
otherwise also exclude `mlp.gate_up_proj` through the router entry `mlp.gate`. Refits reuse the same
pristine-layout record → stage → load → reprocess → fold cycle as the blockwise FP8 path, which keeps
the storage that CUDA graphs captured. vLLM's Marlin/emulation fallbacks allow serving MXFP8 weights on
pre-Blackwell GPUs (SM80+); the served weight grid is still produced by TE's quantizer.

**Where the sync quantizes.** On vLLM the trainer sends bf16 tensors and the vLLM worker quantizes
them on receipt (`quant_weights` in `verl/utils/vllm/vllm_quant_utils.py`). This reuses verl's existing
vLLM FP8 refit path and is not required by MXFP8; SGLang quantizes on the trainer before sending, as its
FP8 path already did. Two consequences:

- The vLLM sync moves bf16 bytes: about 16.4 GB per sync for Qwen3-8B, against 9.7 GB if MXFP8 weights
  plus scales were sent (the embedding and `lm_head` stay bf16 either way), and 61 GB against 32 GB for
  Qwen3-30B-A3B. In the colocated B200 runs this did not dominate: MXFP8 added about 1 s per step to the
  sync on Qwen3-8B (3.2 → 4.2 s), of which TE's quantization was about 11 ms of GPU time; most went to
  restoring loadable layouts (0.57 s) and re-deriving kernel layouts (0.49 s), which the receiver does
  wherever the quantization runs. Disaggregated deployments (the NCCL, Mooncake and other
  checkpoint-engine backends) pay the full bf16 traffic. TODO: send MXFP8 weights plus scales from the
  trainer — quantize the post-update bf16 weights with TE's `MXFP8Quantizer` as the SGLang path does, ask
  the engine which parameters it holds in fp8 instead of re-deriving a name rule, and load E4M3 +
  `weight_scale` through the same staged buffers. TE's cached FP8 weights are not a shortcut: TE
  refreshes them on the next forward pass and verl drops them on offload, so at sync time they can still
  hold the weights from before the last optimizer step.
- The worker decides from the live engine which tensors to quantize: `is_fp8_weight(name, model)`
  resolves each name onto the module that will receive it and checks whether its weight is fp8, so no
  separate name rule has to agree with the engine (a sender-side path needs a separate sync-vs-engine
  dtype check for that). Known gap: `is_fp8_weight` only recognizes `LinearBase` and fused-MoE modules,
  while vLLM's ModelOpt config (0.24 and 0.29) also quantizes `ParallelLMHead` unless it is excluded. A
  quantized `lm_head` therefore reads as not fp8: the sync sends it as bf16, the loader casts it into the
  E4M3 parameter without a scale, and its `weight_scale` is never written. When refit staging allocates
  a fresh buffer for that scale, as it does at TP=2, the buffer keeps its `0xFF` fill (the UE8M0 NaN
  code) and every logit is NaN. Reading the code, this is how the `lm_head` NaN logits in the B200
  validation arose; it has not been re-run on hardware. `lm_head` and the token embedding stay excluded
  (`MXFP8_KEEP_HIGH_PRECISION_LAYERS`); TODO: judge the receiving parameter's dtype instead of the module
  class.

The staging cycle decides per layer whether a refit must go through stage → load → reprocess by
comparing the live parameters with the checkpoint layout recorded at load. A kernel that hands back a
*rewritten copy with the checkpoint's shape and dtype* is invisible to that comparison. FlashInfer
TRT-LLM's MXFP8 MoE preparation (`ModelOptMxFp8FusedMoE` on Blackwell: W13→W31 swap, gate/up row
interleave, tile shuffle of weights and scales) is such a kernel, so verl's patched `replace_parameter`
records the rewrite (the same-shape record was merged upstream as verl-project/verl#7986) and the layer
is staged on every refit. vLLM 0.24's ModelOpt MXFP8 MoE method also processes its weights only once per
layer and returns early afterwards; verl's patched hook clears that flag on every refit, so the kernel
layout is re-derived from the synced scales. Measured on 1×B200 (vLLM 0.24, a tiny Qwen3-MoE, TP1), an
expert's output read relative error 1.739 against a dequantized reference after the first sync without
the record, and 0.052 with it.

**Learning dynamics (cause unresolved).** In the B200 runs (Qwen3-8B on gsm8k with vLLM and with
SGLang, Qwen3-8B on DAPO-Math-17k with vLLM, Qwen3-30B-A3B on DAPO-Math-17k with vLLM; one seed each,
10 to 60 steps), the policy's entropy under MXFP8 training with an MXFP8 rollout stayed flat or rose
slightly (−4% to +6% from the first steps to the end of the run), while it decayed under bf16 (−7% to
−49%) and FP8 tensorwise (−19% to −74%); the one FP8 blockwise run (Qwen3-30B-A3B, 10 steps) also rose
(+9%). An MXFP8 learner with a bf16 rollout landed in between (−23% on gsm8k with vLLM), so the
difference is carried by the trained weights, not only by the rollout's quantization. Training reward
and held-out accuracy ended close to bf16. Compared at matched training reward, the MXFP8 runs on gsm8k
and DAPO-Math-17k reached each reward level at the same step as bf16, with higher entropy. Compared at
matched change from the initial policy (`actor/kl_loss` against the bf16 reference, minus each run's
value at steps 1–3, which is mostly the precision offset), they moved as far as bf16 on gsm8k with vLLM,
about a third less with SGLang, and about 5× less on DAPO-Math-17k. So the logs rule out slower reward
learning over these horizons, but they do not tell whether the retained entropy is useful exploration or
a smaller policy change; separating the two needs saved checkpoints evaluated on fixed contexts with a
bf16 forward, which these runs did not keep. Until then, do not treat step-matched checkpoints from
different recipes as the same point of training, and watch `actor/entropy` when switching recipes.

On Qwen3-30B-A3B (4×B200, vLLM 0.24) the MXFP8 rollout generated 24% faster than bf16; on the dense
Qwen3-8B the measured difference was within run-to-run variation.
