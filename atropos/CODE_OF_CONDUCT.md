# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of the Atropos project, pledge to foster an open and welcoming environment. We aim to make participation in our project a positive, respectful, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of background or experience level.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Unwelcome personal attacks or criticism
* Excessive trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, and related communication channels. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from general open source community standards and GitHub's community guidelines.

Remember: Respect each other, collaborate constructively, and focus on making Atropos better for everyone.
