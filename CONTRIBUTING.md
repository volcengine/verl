## Developing

- **Python-only**: install verl via `pip install -e .[test,vllm]` or `pip install -e .[test,sglang]` and iterate quickly. For full dependency setup, check out the verl [installation doc](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/install.html).

## Code Linting and Formatting

We rely on pre-commit to keep our code consistent. To set it up:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
# for staged changes
pre-commit run
# for all files in the repo
pre-commit run --all-files
# run a specific hook with pre-commit
# pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure --color=always <hood-id>
pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure --color=always ruff
pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure --color=always autogen-trainer-cfg
```

## Testing

Our test suites run on GitHub Actions. Check these workflows for details:
- [GPU unit tests](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/.github/workflows/gpu_unit_tests.yml)
- [CPU unit tests](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/.github/workflows/cpu_unit_tests.yml)
- [vLLM tests](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/.github/workflows/vllm.yml)
- [SGLang tests](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/.github/workflows/sgl.yml)

### Adding CI tests

If possible, please add CI test(s) for your new feature:

1. Find the most relevant workflow yml file, which usually corresponds to a `hydra` default config (e.g. `ppo_trainer`, `ppo_megatron_trainer`, `sft_trainer`, etc).
2. Add related path patterns to the `paths` section if not already included.
3. Minimize the workload of the test script(s) (see existing scripts for examples).

## Building the Docs
```
# Ensure verl is on your PYTHONPATH, e.g.:
pip install -e .[test]

# Install documentation dependencies

pip install -r requirements-docs.txt

# Generate HTML docs
make clean
make html

# Preview locally
python -m http.server -d _build/html/
```
Open your browser at http://localhost:8000 to explore the docs.
